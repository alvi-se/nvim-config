# Neovim Config

## Prerequisites
This config assumes a system as following:
- Arch Linux (btw)
- Wayland

## Installation

```sh
sudo pacman -S neovim npm wl-clipboard
```

- `neovim` (of course)
- `npm` to install some language servers
- `wl-clipboard` to integrate Neovim with the system clipboard (only on Wayland)
